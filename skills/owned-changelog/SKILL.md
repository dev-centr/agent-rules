# Owned-project changelog

Applies to repositories the user **owns or created**, not third-party contributions unless they ask.

If the repo already has a changelog, **match that style** (layout, tense, headings). The structure below is the house default when you are creating or repairing one.

## Always

- Record **functional** changes.
- Link the changelog from the README (Changelog section).
- Index page named **changelog** (timeline of dates + short summaries + links).
- Detail pages under `changelog-details/` named `date - title`.
- Wire into the active docs system (Antora nav, etc.) when docs exist. If the project has no docs, put the changelog at the repo base.
- Reader-facing summaries assume a stranger scanning the timeline — not chat context (`general/documentation.md` Audience / POV).

## Create or backfill

If none exists: **create it** and **backfill** from observed functional changes in git history. Unpack commits when the subject line is too thin.

When you add docs later, update the changelog structure so it still fits.

## Cross-repo wiring

Wiring may need commits in **related** repositories (org docs hub playbook). If those repos cross **org** boundaries and CI/docs fetch needs auth, **alert the user** which secret must be added on which org/repo — do not invent credentials.
